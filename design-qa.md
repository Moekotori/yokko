# Yokko Song Select design QA

final result: passed

## Evidence

- Reference visual: `C:\Users\nyafa\AppData\Local\Temp\codex-clipboard-c8ee9a51-8c45-4121-a170-3157ae072f09.png`
- User-reported broken implementation: `C:\Users\nyafa\AppData\Local\Temp\codex-clipboard-4df5ee61-f358-4985-9b7c-1a8efb877111.png`
- Final implementation screenshot: `D:\YOKKO\artifacts\song-select-implementation-v5.png`
- Side-by-side comparison: `D:\YOKKO\artifacts\song-select-comparison-v5.png`
- State inspected: Blue Signal selected, Global Ranking selected, five leaderboard rows visible.

## Full-view comparison

The final screen keeps the reference's strong left-detail/right-browser composition, fixed bottom action bar, chart-driven full-page background, navy glass panels, cyan/pink/yellow accents, and compact rhythm-game typography. The implementation deliberately uses a five-row leaderboard and moves Length/BPM beside the difficulty summary to preserve vertical space.

## Focused region comparison

- Leaderboard: all five positions are fully visible above the footer. Avatar, rank, player name, grade emblem, score, accuracy, mods, and current-player treatment remain readable without collisions.
- Selected-song summary: title, artist, mapper, key mode, difficulty, stars, numeric rating, length, and BPM form one compact hierarchy.
- Mascot/footer: the mascot is reduced and placed below the leaderboard, no longer obscuring the fourth/fifth rows or song statistics.
- Browser: filter/search controls and five chart rows are visible. Demo rows use the selected chart fallback background; imported charts are expected to provide their own beatmap background.

## Findings

- No P0, P1, or P2 issue remains in the inspected state.
- P3 accepted deviation: the implementation uses background strips rather than album-art thumbnails because the current data model is chart-background driven.
- P3 accepted deviation: the selected chart remains at the top of the list rather than being vertically centered; selection, filtering, and keyboard movement are functional.

## Comparison history

1. Broken state:
   - P1: leaderboard rows collided with the mascot and Length/BPM block.
   - P1: fourth and fifth positions were partially hidden.
   - P2: grade letters read like unstyled placeholder text.
2. Fix:
   - Moved Length/BPM above the leaderboard.
   - Reduced leaderboard row/avatar typography and kept five rows.
   - Replaced grade letters with bordered grade emblems.
   - Reduced and lowered the mascot.
3. Post-fix:
   - Side-by-side visual comparison shows no overlap, clipping, or unreadable hierarchy.

## Verification

- `dotnet build .\Yokko.Desktop.slnf --no-restore -p:AllowUnsafeBlocks=true`: passed with 0 warnings and 0 errors.
- Focused Song Select and localisation tests: passed, 10/10.
- Covered interactions: song selection, 7K filter, search/no-results recovery, global/personal ranking switch, and pushing Gameplay from Play.
